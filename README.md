# AI4EDA-Journey
Notes, Codes, and Thoughts on AI for Electronic Design Automation

## To My Future Self of 2031
*Written on Feb 15, 2026, in a season of anxiety and waiting*

Hey, hopefully, you are reading this as a Research Scientist or a PhD graduate who has made a dent in the EDA industry.  
Remember today? You are struggling with your first work, worrying about being a clown if it all failed. But you decided to start anyway.  
**"The best time to plant a tree is 10 years ago. The next best time is now."**  
Thank you for not giving up on that day.

## About This Repository
This is a learning log of my journey into AI4EDA (Artificial Intelligence for Electronic Design Automation).

**Why open source?**
1. **Work Trace:** To visualize my daily progress (accumulating those green squares!).
2. **Knowledge Base:** To organize notes on GNNs, Physical Design, and **...** (updating as I learn)
3. **Connection:** To share with anyone also starting from scratch in this challenging but promising field.

## Repository Structure
- `/Basics`: Foundational notes and study materials.
- `/Papers`: Research paper reading notes.
- `/Code`: Coding practice and small projects.
